      <h1>About Tskr</h1>
      <p>This is a tool with a goal, open source, low cost, configurable task and asset tracking.  There's lots of tools out there that do this but they are either hosted by some corp, expensive, or bad.  We wanted to make a tool that you could host on a CDN, or selfhost, that has a relatively low cost, that uses new tech.</p>
      <p>Do you like this?  Do you want support?  Reach out to me via email <a href="mailto:jace@benson.run?subject=I like what you're doing on tskr.io&body=What can I do for you?">ðŸ“§</a></p>
